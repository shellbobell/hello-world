# hello-world
<br />Practicing GitHub Flow.
<br />About me: Learning to use GitHub for a career transition from Operational/Process Engineering to Data Analytics/Engineering. I currently am an operations manager for Alternative Fuels system in a cement plant where we burn solid processed waste material to supplement natural gas in our pyroprocess.  I also have a background in database management, GIS, and mapping - I've worked in several sectors: health care, oil and gas, mining, and manufacturing.  I've always gravitated towards programming and automation.  I'm leaning towards data analytics because it incorporates the following: programming, analysis, critical-thinking, complex mathematics, statistics, organization, database management, and, of course, beautifying visualize for everyone to understand the data.
